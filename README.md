# benchmark-playground

This is a passion project that seeks to benchmark various algorithms using different programming languages. I use this project to not only discover the difference in performances between different programming languages, but also to learn how to wrte code in newer languages by building the different benchmarking infrastructures in each language.

Benchmarking infrastructure has been set up using the following languages so far:

* C
* Go
* Python
* Rust
* Zig (in progress)
