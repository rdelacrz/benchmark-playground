# Crystal Benchmark Runner

The following subpackage runs benchmarks using code written in **Crystal**, which is a compiled language with Ruby-inspired syntax. More information about it can be read [here](https://crystal-lang.org).

## Prerequisites

The Crystal sources must be downloaded and installed with the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Building Crystal Benchmark Runner

This command will build **Crystal Benchmark Runner** using **Crystal**'s `build` command. If the optional `-d` flag is passed as well (i.e. `./build.sh -d`), it will generate the debug version of the build.
```
./build.sh
```

## Running Crystal Benchmark Runner

This command will run the executable generated by the build step, passing any CLI parameters directly to the executable.
```
./run.sh -o <operation_name> -i <input_file> -c <execution_count>
```

Example: `./run.sh -i ../../inputs/random_string_list.json -o QuickSort -c 1000`
