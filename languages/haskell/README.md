# Haskell Benchmark Runner

The following subpackage runs benchmarks using code written in **Haskell**, a purely functional language that was initially created in 1990.

## Prerequisites

Developing with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) requires [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup) to install and manage the Haskell toolchain. The following instructions will assume that the operating system hosting this application is Ubuntu.

### Installing the GHCup Installer

**GHCup** is the main installer for Haskell. It can be installed on Linux with the following command.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```

## Building Haskell Benchmark Runner

This command will build **Haskell Benchmark Runner** using **Haskell**'s `build` command. If the optional `-d` flag is passed as well (i.e. `./build.sh -d`), it will generate the debug version of the build.
```
./build.sh
```

## Running Haskell Benchmark Runner

This command will run the executable generated by the build step, passing any CLI parameters directly to the executable.
```
./run.sh -o <operation_name> -i <input_file> -c <execution_count>
```

Example: `./run.sh -i ../../inputs/random_string_list.json -o QuickSort -c 1000`
